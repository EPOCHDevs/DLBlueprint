## Installation
To install DLBlueprint, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including:
   - `CMake` version 3.17 or higher
   - `fmt` library
   - `Boost` library
   - `yaml-cpp` library
   - `tl-ranges` library
   - `libtorch` (PyTorch C++ library)
3. Install all dependencies with vcpkg (libtorch requires you to download seperately)
4. Compile the project using CMake.

## Usage
To use DLBlueprint, follow these steps:
1. Create a YAML configuration file specifying the architecture of your deep learning model.
2. Load the YAML file in your C++ code using the `YAML::LoadFile` function.
3. Build the model using `dlb::Build` function, passing the input dimension and the YAML configuration.
4. Reset the state of the model if necessary.
5. Access the compiled modules and perform forward pass using the generated blueprint.
